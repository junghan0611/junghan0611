"""timeline/collect.py — read the existing surfaces, emit the LOCAL FULL event log.

    python3 timeline/collect.py --out events.jsonl

Five sources, no network, nothing invented — read at four depths of the same day:
git repos under ~/repos and Denote notes under ~/org (depth 3), the agent agenda under
~/org/botlog/agenda (2), the operator's own journal headings (1), and the time blocks he
logs by hand, read through the `lifetract` skill rather than parsed here (0).

This is the LOCAL FULL. Titles and refs are kept exactly as they read on this machine.
What may be published is a separate and *later* question that deliberately does not live
here: a collector that decides what to hide is a wall, and the point of this axis is to
open one.

    a block is an interval, sleep crosses midnight almost every night, and 150 blocks carry

    `ok` while the blocks stop in May tells the reader that those weeks were unlived. So

    than unlived, and the source is `stale`. If nothing else speaks for those days either,
    depth 0 lagging by a day or two says nothing false, and the run stays `ok` — which is
    why this does not cry wolf every morning before the export.
